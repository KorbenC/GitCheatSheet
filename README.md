## <a name='overview'>Overview</a>

- When you first setup Git, set up your user name and email address so your first commits record them properly.

```
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "user@email.com"
```

##**About Git, GitHub, and Heroku**
 - Git is a free and open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

 - GitHub is the best way to collaborate around your code. Fork, send pull requests, and manage all your public and private repositories.

 - Heroku is a cloud application platform that supports a number of different programming languages including Java, Ruby, Node.js, and Clojure. It's a new way of building and deploying web apps.

## <a name='basic'>Basic Git Workflow Example</a>

 - Initialize a new git repository, then stage all the files in the directory and finally commit the initial snapshot.

```bash
$ git init
$ git add *
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
```
 - Create a new branch named featureA, then check it out so it is the active branch. then edit and stage some files and finally commit the new snapshot.

```bash
$ git branch featureA
$ git checkout featureA
$ (edit files)
$ git add (files)
$ git commit -m 'add feature A'
```
 - Switch back to the master branch, reverting the featureA changes you just made, then edit some files and commit your new changes directly in the master branch context.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ (edit files)
$ git commit -a -m 'change files'
```
 - Merge the featureA changes into the master branch context, combining all your work. Finally delete the featureA branch.

```bash
$ git merge featureA
$ git branch -d featureA
```

## <a name='setup'>Setup & Init</a>

**Git configuration, and repository initialization and cloning.**
 - set a config value int his repository

git config [key][value]
```
 - set a config value globally for this user

```bash
git config --global [key][value]
```
 - initialize an existing directory as a Git repository

```bash
git init
```
 - clone a git repository from a URL

```bash

```
 - get help on any Git command

```bash

## <a name='stage'>Stage & Snapshot</a>

**Working with snapshots and the Git staging area**
 - Show the status of what is staged for your next commit and what is modified in your working directory

```bash
git status
```
 - add a file as it looks now to your next commit(stage)

```bash
git add [file]
```
 - reset the staging area for a file so that the change is not in your next commit (unstage)

```bash
git reset [file]
```
 - diff of what is changed but not staged

```bash
git diff
```
 - diff of what is staged but not yet committed

```bash
git diff --staged
```
 - commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

```bash
git commit
```
 - remove a file from your working directory and unstage

```bash
git rm [file]
```
 - tcl/tk GUI program to make all of these commands simpler

```bash
git gui
```

## <a name='branch'>Branch & Merge</a>

**Working with Git branches and the stash**
- List your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch

```bash
git branch
```
 - Create a new branch at the current directory

```bash
git branch [branch-name]
```
 - Switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory

```bash
git checkout [branch]
```
 - Create a branch and immediately switch to it

```bash
git checkout -b [branch]
```
 - Merge another branch into your currently active one and record the merge as a commit

```bash
git merge [branch]
```
 - Show commit logs

```bash
git log
```
 - Stash away the currently uncommitted modifications in your working directory temporarily

```bash
git stash
```
 - re-apply the last stashed changes

## <a name='share'>Share & Update</a>

**Fetching, merging, and working with updates from another repository.**
 - add a git URL as an alias

```bash
git remote add [alias] [url]
```
 - Fetch down all the branches from that Git remote

```bash
git fetch [alias]
```
 - Merge a branch on the server into your currently active branch to bring it up to date

```bash
git merge [alias]/[branch]
```
 - Push the work on your branch to update that branch on the remote git repository

```bash
git push [alias] [branch]
```
 - Fetch from the URL tracked by the current branch and immediately try to merge in the tracked branch

```bash
git pull
```

## <a name='inspect'>Inspect & Compare</a>

**Examing logs, diffs, and object information**
 - Show the commit history for the currently active branch

```bash
git log
```
 - Show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB

```bash
git log branchB..branchA
```
 - Show the commits that changed file, even across renames

```bash
git log --follow [file]
```
 - Show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB

```bash
git diff branchB...branchA
```
 - Show any object in Git in human-readable format

```bash
git show [SHA]
```
 - tcl/tk program to show the commit log in a GUI

```bash
gitx
```

## <a name='github'>Contributing on GitHub</a>

**To contibute to a project hosted on GitHub you can fork the project on github.com, then clone your fork locally, make a change, push back to GitHub, and then send a pull request, which will email the maintainer.**
 - Fork project on github

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/my-user/project
$ cd project
$ (edit files)
$ git add (files)
$ git commit -m 'Explain what I changed'
$ git push origin master

 - Go to github and click 'pull request' button

## <a name='heroku'>Deploying to Heroku with Git</a>
 - Use the heroku command-line tool to create an application and git remote:

```bash
$ heroku create

[Creating glowing-dusk-965... done, stack is bamboo-mri-1.9.2
http://glowing-dusk-965.heroku.com/ <http://glowing-dusk-965.
heroku.com/> | git@heroku.com:glowing-dusk-965.git <x-msg://563/
git&heroku.com:glowing-dusk-965.git> Git remote heroku added]
```
 - Use git to deploy the application

```bash
$ git push heroku master
```
 - Create an additional Heroku app for staging, and name the git remote "staging".

```bash
$ heroku create my-staging-app --remote staging
```
 - Use git to deploy the application via the staging remote.

```bash
$ git push staging master
```
